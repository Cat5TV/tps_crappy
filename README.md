**June 30, 2016: `<carolyn@TPS-Lego>` WORST SERVER EVER**

Here at TPS, we realized we could do even crappier for players like carolyn. And so, TPS-Crappy was created to ensure we really are providing them the WORST SERVER EVER.

This is the Minetest game, tps_crappy.

Still to do (feel free to submit pull requests):
- More crappy skins. If possible randomly assign one on first connect
