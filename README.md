**June 30, 2016: `<carolyn@TPS-Lego>` WORST SERVER EVER**

Here at TPS, we realized we could do even crappier for players like carolyn. And so, TPS-Crappy was created to ensure we really are providing them the WORST SERVER EVER.

This is the Minetest game, tps_crappy.

Still to do (feel free to submit pull requests):
- Crayon skybox
- Crayon sun
- Crayon moon
- Switch sun and moon, so it's sun at night and moon during the day
- Rotate textures of treetrunks and brick by 90% so they are the wrong way
- Pick a flower. Any flower. rotare texture by 180 degrees and let that one be upside down
- More crappy skins. If possible randomly assign one on first connect
- Add mypaint and mypaint_extras so the world gets painted rediculus colors
